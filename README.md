### Description
Back end Rails server used to store User and Party data created in [juju-frontend](https://github.com/justinw827/juju-frontend).
Utilizes the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
Application links with user's Spotify accounts using OAuth 2.0 specifications. Authentication of user
is handled by Spotify, thus a Spotify account is required to run application.

Full application (front end & back end) allows you to log in with your Spotify account, linking your account with the app. Once logged in, you can create a party, which also creates a Spotify playlist in your account. Other people can join your party and add songs to your playlist, making the playlist a queue of songs. Songs are added to the queue (playlist) by searching for a song in the search bar, and clicking 'Add to Queue', adding the song to the active party's playlist.
